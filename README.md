### Cryptocurrencies


In this project, I am using unsupervised learning to analyze data on the cryptocurrencies traded on the market.

In order to analyze the data, the following steps occurred: 

  - Data Preprocessing and Cleaning
  - Prepare the data for dimensions reduction with PCA and clustering using K-means.
  - Reduce data dimensions using PCA algorithms from sklearn.
  - Predict clusters using cryptocurrencies data using the K-means algorithm form sklearn.
  - Create some plots and data tables to present your results.
